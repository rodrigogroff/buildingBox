					In order to acchieve this, a <b>dedicated repository</b> is created for each
					of our clients - instead of the old strategy of turning off and on features in a
					big, slow, hard to maintain software version of our program.
					<br /><br />

				<h3>
					This way, <b>we know for sure</b> your OWN version of our software is completely
					dedicated (even running in exclusive hardware!) and the code is minimal, fast and 
					completely designed and implemented for you.
